The use of technology in the school, such as visual learning, has made Little Einsteins' Tutorial a forerunner among schools for modern learning. We encourage critical thinking, practical application, and appreciation for the arts through:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Different clubs for learning things such as French, dance, music, debate, art and crafts, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Completing the Holy Quran within Grade 5 starting from KG.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>Discipline</h3>
      <p>
        The precepts of respect, responsibility, persistence and fairness are instilled in our students as part of thier education. This creates a structured, nurturing environment in which they can learn. Adoption of these same principles further prepares them to become good citizens, coworkers, and neighbours in the future.
